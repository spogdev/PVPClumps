## What is it?
Designed to solve the problems of finding a viable Clumps plugin for PVP.
- SMP core is paid, and comes with a bunch of heavyweight features some people may not want and at the time of writing this It doesn't work for me which is mostly why I made this.
- "Clumps" plugin isn't up to standard with most pvp servers and requires configuration to get working that some people may not know.

## Features
- Works out of the box with no setup required.
- Groups according to popular practice servers.
- Solves the lag caused by experience orbs.
